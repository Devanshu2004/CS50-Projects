# The Magic Hat

#### Description:

In my final project I have created a python program which works just like the 'Magic Hat' in the Harry Potter movie series and I even wanted to name my final project as 'The Talking Hat' but 'The Magic Hat' suited better.

As we know (for those who have read or seen Harry Potter) the main work of the hat is to choose whether the student goes in which of the house from the list of houses namely, "Gryffindor", "Ravenclaw", "Hufflepuff", "Slytherin".

The magic hat decides the appropriate house for the students by knowing their names and qualities. It also knows that in which grade that student is.

The different qualities belonging to different houses a as follow :-

["courage", "loyalty", "adventure"] belongs to the house "Gryffindor"
["dedication", "patience", "honesty"] belongs to the house "Hufflepuff"
["wisdom", "creativity", "perfectionism"] belongs to the house "Ravenclaw"
["ambition", "competitive", "leadership"] belongs to the house "Slytherin"

So, let us take an example from the csv file inserted in the final project. There is a student named 'Cho Chang' whose one of the quality is 'creativity' and the year she joined the Harry Potter movie series was 2007, so if the magic hat is given her name it would say 'Ravenclaw' and 'Grade 10' as 'creativity' is the quality of the students belonging the the house named 'Ravenclaw'. The project program works in the same way and it will give the same output what the magic hat would have given in the movie or the book.

Well the magic hat in the Harry Potter series is also able to talk to the students and others as well so firstly I wanted to create the magic hat such that it could read out or I might say speak up the name, house and the year of the particular student according to his or her qualities and age. So I tried to import the 'pyttsx3' library and then I was getting some errors in the source code of 'pyttse3' library, so I had to create the program that cannot speak unfortunately.

And that's why I made a program which works nearly like the magic hat, it requires a CSV file as an input which should be containing the name of the respective student, their quality and the year in which they joined Hogwarts. The program will see the qualities of the student and then decide where to keep that particular student and then the program will check the joining date of that student and then the program will also be able to decide that in which year/grade that student is.

The program will then create a new file and then insert the name, house and grade of that student, there by working like the magic hat in the movie and books. In the final file, the data would be like name, house and then the appropriate grade for that student.

It took me a bit longer than the time which went in usual problem sets.

And hence, "The Magic Hat".
